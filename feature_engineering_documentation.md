# Feature Engineering Documentation  
## Customer Churn Prediction

## 1. Introduction  

Feature engineering is the process of creating new, meaningful features from raw data to improve the performance and interpretability of machine learning models. While raw variables describe basic customer attributes, engineered features capture deeper behavioral patterns, customer value, and churn risk factors.

This document describes the feature engineering techniques applied to the **customer_churn.csv** dataset and explains the rationale behind each newly created feature.

## 2. Dataset Context  

The **customer_churn.csv** dataset contains customer subscription information, including billing details, tenure, contract type, payment method, and churn status. Although the original dataset provides useful information, it does not explicitly represent customer value, lifecycle stage, or payment behavior, which are critical for churn prediction.

Feature engineering was performed to enhance the dataset by incorporating business-driven insights.

## 3. Engineered Features Overview  

The following five new features were created to enrich the dataset and improve predictive performance:

| Feature Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Customer_Lifetime_Value | Total revenue contribution of a customer |
| High_Value_Customer | Indicator for high-value customers |
| Tenure_Group | Customer lifecycle categorization |
| Payment_Efficiency | Payment behavior efficiency metric |
| High_Monthly_Charge | Indicator for high monthly billing |

Each feature is explained in detail below.

## 4. Feature Descriptions and Rationale  

### 4.1 Customer_Lifetime_Value  

**Definition:**  
Customer_Lifetime_Value represents the total revenue generated by a customer over their relationship with the company.

**Calculation:**  
Customer_Lifetime_Value = MonthlyCharges × Tenure

**Business Rationale:**  
Customers with higher lifetime value are more important to retain. This feature allows the model to differentiate between low-value and high-value customers and assess churn risk accordingly.

### 4.2 High_Value_Customer  

**Definition:**  
A binary indicator identifying customers whose lifetime value is above the dataset median.

**Logic:**  
High_Value_Customer = 1 if CLV > median(CLV), else 0

**Business Rationale:**  
This feature simplifies customer segmentation by highlighting high-value customers, enabling targeted retention strategies for customers who contribute more revenue.

### 4.3 Tenure_Group  

**Definition:**  
Categorical feature that groups customers based on their tenure duration.

**Categories:**  
- New Customers  
- Medium-Term Customers  
- Long-Term Customers  

**Business Rationale:**  
Customer churn behavior often varies by lifecycle stage. New customers are generally more likely to churn, while long-term customers tend to be more loyal. Grouping tenure improves the model’s ability to capture lifecycle-related churn patterns.

### 4.4 Payment_Efficiency  

**Definition:**  
Represents how efficiently a customer pays relative to their tenure.

**Calculation:**  
Payment_Efficiency = TotalCharges / (Tenure + 1)

**Business Rationale:**  
This feature captures customer payment behavior by measuring average charges over time. Unusual payment efficiency values may indicate billing issues or dissatisfaction, which can contribute to churn.

### 4.5 High_Monthly_Charge  

**Definition:**  
Binary indicator identifying customers with monthly charges above the dataset average.

**Logic:**  
High_Monthly_Charge = 1 if MonthlyCharges > mean(MonthlyCharges), else 0

**Business Rationale:**  
Pricing is a major churn driver. Customers with higher monthly charges may feel cost pressure and are more likely to churn. This feature allows the model to capture pricing sensitivity explicitly.

## 5. Encoding of Engineered Features  

- Binary engineered features were retained as numeric (0/1)
- Categorical engineered features such as `Tenure_Group` were converted into numerical format using **One-Hot Encoding**

This ensured all engineered features were compatible with machine learning algorithms.

## 6. Impact on Model Readiness  

The engineered features enhance the dataset by:
- Capturing customer value and revenue contribution
- Representing customer lifecycle stages
- Highlighting pricing and payment behavior
- Improving separation between churned and retained customers

These enhancements improve both model accuracy and interpretability.

## 7. Conclusion  

Feature engineering transformed the original **customer_churn.csv** dataset into a richer and more informative dataset suitable for churn prediction. The newly created features incorporate business knowledge and behavioral insights that are not directly available in raw data. This process significantly strengthens the foundation for building accurate and explainable machine learning models.
