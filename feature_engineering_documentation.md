# Feature Engineering Documentation  
## Customer Churn Prediction (Week 10)

---

## 1. Introduction  

Feature engineering is the process of creating new, meaningful features from raw data to improve the performance and interpretability of machine learning models. While raw variables describe basic customer attributes, engineered features capture deeper behavioral patterns, customer value, and churn risk factors.

This document describes the feature engineering techniques applied to the **customer_churn.csv** dataset and explains the rationale behind each newly created feature.

## 2. Dataset Context  

The **customer_churn.csv** dataset contains customer subscription information, including billing details, tenure, contract type, payment method, and churn status. Although the original dataset provides useful information, it does not explicitly represent customer value, lifecycle stage, or payment behavior, which are critical for churn prediction.

Feature engineering was performed to enhance the dataset by incorporating business-driven insights.

## 3. Engineered Features Overview  

The following five new features were created to enrich the dataset and improve predictive performance:

| Feature Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Customer_Lifetime_Value | Total revenue contribution of a customer |
| High_Value_Customer | Indicator for high-value customers |
| Tenure_Group | Customer lifecycle categorization |
| Payment_Efficiency | Payment behavior efficiency metric |
| High_Monthly_Charge | Indicator for high monthly billing |

Each feature is explained in detail below.

## 4. Feature Descriptions and Rationale  

### 4.1 Customer_Lifetime_Value  

**Definition:**  
Customer_Lifetime_Value represents the total revenue generated by a customer over their relationship with the company.

**Calculation:**
